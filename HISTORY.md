# History
In ancient times (1999), IBM decided to release the demons of hell with the best of intentions. BSF was a scripting framework, with languages that could run on the JVM. These languages included: Tcl, Python, Netrexx, JavaScript.

But, they were not satisfied, and so dug deeper. They spawned the beginning of the end, the wailing of the dammed. They let you script Java in Java.

This continued for a couple of years, at which they passed the cursed library over to the Apache foundation. Immediately sensing the great evil, the engine was scrapped and the functionality removed, but they were already cursed.

They turned to Beanshell, which was a dynamic interpreter, an admirable goal. However, as with all pursuits of man, they were not satisfied with mere standards, and updated it in their own image. Creating a superset of the language, but stuck at 1.4.

Although incomplete in comparison, between evil, and mind rendering evil, Apache chose.

As this state of affairs continued, Apache worked on a new library, to produce a new standard so they could truly break free from the tentacles of legacy. It was more modern (2005-2007), and written with only sane languages in mind. The original Beanshell breathed it's last around this time, a victim of it's own aspirations.

Apache was finally free, with the new library taking life in the halls of Javax, a testimonial to a war hard won. Weary, and tired after the battle, Apache retired from the project (2011), happy that it's new framework would lead a new generation of Java developers in the right direction. However, no useful evil can go untouched.
